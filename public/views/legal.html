                    Some of the examples published on the Website for educational purposes include hypothetical, back-tested results that were achieved by means of the retroactive application of a back-tested portfolio. The corresponding results have inherent limitations, including: (a) the portfolio results do not reflect the results of actual trading using investor assets, but were achieved by means of the retroactive application of each of the referenced portfolios, certain aspects of which may have been designed with the benefit of hindsight; (b) back tested performance may not reflect the impact that any material market or economic factors might have had on the adviser’s use of the hypothetical portfolio if the portfolio had been used during the period to actually mange investor assets; (c) for various reasons (including the reasons indicated above), subscribers may have experienced investment results during the corresponding time periods that were materially different from those portrayed in the portfolio. All hypothetical results were compiled by the Publisher and not independently verified.
